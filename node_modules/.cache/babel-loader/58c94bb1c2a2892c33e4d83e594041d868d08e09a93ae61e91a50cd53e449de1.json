This week\\'s application is to build a CMS-style blog site, similar to WordPress, specifically designed for developers to publish their blog posts and engage in discussions by commenting on other developers\\' posts. You will create this site from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. The application will follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern, utilizing Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, and the express-session npm package for authentication.',\n      Repo: 'https://github.com/kpetrosky/Progressive-Web-Applications-PWA-Challenge-Text-Editor',\n      deployed: 'https://salty-retreat-66567-6f83efb5ca5c.herokuapp.com/',\n      src: mvc,\n      backgroundColor: '#a74482ff',\n      toolsUsed: 'Express.js, APIs, Handlebars.js, Sequelize, Heroku.',\n    },\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1 className=\"text-center\">Portfolio Page</h1>\n      <p>\n        {/* Rest of the content */}\n      </p>\n      <div className='row'>\n        {projects.map(project => (\n          <div className='col-md-4 col-sm-12' key={project.id}>\n            <div className=\"card\" style={{ backgroundColor: project.backgroundColor }}>\n              {/* Render project details */}\n              <img src={project.src} className=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"...\" />\n              <div className=\"card-body\">\n                <h5 className=\"card-title\" style={{ fontSize: '24px' }}>{project.name}</h5>\n                <p className=\"card-text\" style={{ fontSize: '18px' }}>{project.description}{project.toolsUsed}</p>\n                <a href={project.Repo} target=\"_blank\" className=\"btn btn-primary me-3\">Github Repo</a>\n                <a href={project.deployed} target=\"_blank\" className=\"btn btn-primary\">Deployed Application</a>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        ))}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AAEzB,OAAOC,QAAQ,MAAM,2BAA2B;AAChD,OAAOC,OAAO,MAAM,0BAA0B;AAE9C,OAAOC,GAAG,MAAM,sBAAsB;AACtC;AACA;AACA,OAAOC,GAAG,MAAM,sBAAsB;AACtC,OAAOC,SAAS,MAAM,oCAAoC;AAC1D,OAAOC,IAAI,MAAM,+CAA+C;AAAA,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAGhE,eAAe,SAASC,SAASA,CAAA,EAAG;EAClC,MAAMC,QAAQ,GAAG,CACf;IACEC,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;IACLC,IAAI,EAAE,oBAAoB;IAC1BC,WAAW,EAAE,mvBAAmvB;IAChwBC,IAAI,EAAE,gDAAgD;IACtDC,QAAQ,EAAE,kDAAkD;IAC5DC,GAAG,EAAEf,QAAQ;IACbgB,eAAe,EAAE,WAAW;IAC5BC,SAAS,EAAE;EACb,CAAC,EACD;IACEP,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;IACLC,IAAI,EAAE,oBAAoB;IAC1BC,WAAW,EAAE,ipBAAipB;IAC9pBC,IAAI,EAAE,0DAA0D;IAChEC,QAAQ,EAAE,4DAA4D;IACtEC,GAAG,EAAEd,OAAO;IACZe,eAAe,EAAE,WAAW;IAC5BC,SAAS,EAAE;EACb,CAAC,EACD;IACEP,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;IACLC,IAAI,EAAE,8BAA8B;IACpCC,WAAW,EAAE,ghCAAghC;IAC7hCC,IAAI,EAAE,uDAAuD;IAC7DC,QAAQ,EAAE,uDAAuD;IACjEC,GAAG,EAAEX,SAAS;IACdY,eAAe,EAAE,WAAW;IAC5BC,SAAS,EAAE;EACb,CAAC,EACD;IACEP,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;IACLC,IAAI,EAAE,2BAA2B;IACjCC,WAAW,EAAE,gmCAAgmC;IAC7mCC,IAAI,EAAE,mDAAmD;IACzDC,QAAQ,EAAE,mEAAmE;IAC7EC,GAAG,EAAEV,IAAI;IACTW,eAAe,EAAE,WAAW;IAC5BC,SAAS,EAAE;EACb,CAAC,EACD;IACEP,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;IACLC,IAAI,EAAE,8CAA8C;IACpDC,WAAW,EAAE,s+BAAs+B;IACn/BC,IAAI,EAAE,qFAAqF;IAC3FC,QAAQ,EAAE,wCAAwC;IAClDC,GAAG,EAAEZ,GAAG;IACRa,eAAe,EAAE,WAAW;IAC5BC,SAAS,EAAE;EACb,CAAC,EACD;IACEP,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;IACLC,IAAI,EAAE,8CAA8C;IACpDC,WAAW,EAAE,wwBAAwwB;IACrxBC,IAAI,EAAE,qFAAqF;IAC3FC,QAAQ,EAAE,yDAAyD;IACnEC,GAAG,EAAEb,GAAG;IACRc,eAAe,EAAE,WAAW;IAC5BC,SAAS,EAAE;EACb,CAAC,CACF;EAED,oBACEV,OAAA;IAAAW,QAAA,gBACEX,OAAA;MAAIY,SAAS,EAAC,aAAa;MAAAD,QAAA,EAAC;IAAc;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC/ChB,OAAA;MAAAa,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAEG,CAAC,eACJhB,OAAA;MAAKY,SAAS,EAAC,KAAK;MAAAD,QAAA,EACjBT,QAAQ,CAACe,GAAG,CAACC,OAAO,iBACnBlB,OAAA;QAAKY,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAoB;QAAAD,QAAA,eACjCX,OAAA;UAAKY,SAAS,EAAC,MAAM;UAACO,KAAK,EAAE;YAAEV,eAAe,EAAES,OAAO,CAACT;UAAgB,CAAE;UAAAE,QAAA,gBAExEX,OAAA;YAAKQ,GAAG,EAAEU,OAAO,CAACV,GAAI;YAACI,SAAS,EAAC,cAAc;YAACQ,GAAG,EAAC;UAAK;YAAAP,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eAC5DhB,OAAA;YAAKY,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAD,QAAA,gBACxBX,OAAA;cAAIY,SAAS,EAAC,YAAY;cAACO,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEE,QAAQ,EAAE;cAAO,CAAE;cAAAV,QAAA,EAAEO,OAAO,CAACd;YAAI;cAAAS,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAK,CAAC,eAC3EhB,OAAA;cAAGY,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;cAACO,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEE,QAAQ,EAAE;cAAO,CAAE;cAAAV,QAAA,GAAEO,OAAO,CAACb,WAAW,EAAEa,OAAO,CAACR,SAAS;YAAA;cAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAClGhB,OAAA;cAAGsB,IAAI,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACZ,IAAK;cAACiB,MAAM,EAAC,QAAQ;cAACX,SAAS,EAAC,sBAAsB;cAAAD,QAAA,EAAC;YAAW;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACvFhB,OAAA;cAAGsB,IAAI,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACX,QAAS;cAACgB,MAAM,EAAC,QAAQ;cAACX,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAiB;cAAAD,QAAA,EAAC;YAAoB;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAC5F,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACH;MAAC,GAViCE,OAAO,CAACf,EAAE;QAAAU,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAW9C,CACN;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACC,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACH,CAAC;AAEV;AAACQ,EAAA,GAxFuBvB,SAAS;AAAA,IAAAuB,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
